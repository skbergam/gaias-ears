        Analyze this conversation transcript and identify opportunities for assistance. 
        Look for these specific types:
        
        1. QUESTION/UNKNOWN: When speakers express ignorance or ask questions they don't know the answer to
           - Examples: "I wonder if...", "Do you know...", "Is there a way to..."
        
        2. MEMORY RETRIEVAL: When speakers try to recall something specific but can't fully remember
           - Examples: "I saw this article...", "There was this study...", "I read somewhere..."
        
        3. GENERATIVE MOMENT: When speakers engage in "what if" scenarios or imagine something that doesn't exist
           - Examples: "What if we could...", "Imagine if...", "Picture this..."
        
        For each opportunity found:
        - Generate helpful content (search results, explanations, or creative descriptions)
        - Explain why this card appeared based on what was said
        - Make it contextually relevant and unobtrusive
        
        Transcript: "${transcript}"
        
        Only return opportunities that are clearly identifiable and would genuinely help the conversation.
        If no clear opportunities exist, return an empty array.
